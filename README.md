# matplotlib-GUI-XLSwritein-data-covidcase
This is a practice for reading datas from Excel(using xlrd), preprocessing data, make graphs, and combine graphs with tkinter.
Data contain Covid cases in early April for only 9 days(4/1-9).

Firstly, I read data of dayes and Covid cases from 3 different cities.
And then, creating a tkinter window with 6 subplots.
